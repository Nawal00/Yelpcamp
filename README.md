### App overview - 'Yelp Camp'

A socially engaging app I made following online lessons during my time studying online Web Development course at Udemey. The project introduced me to Node.js, Express, npm, MongoDB and user authorisation and authentication. Through the course, Iâ€™ve managed to build on a good foundation knoweldge of full stack technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, RESTful, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Git, Github and Heroku.

The Yelp Camp app allows users to look for campgrounds and create new campgrounds site. The user can rate the campgrounds and leave comments. The campground's location is also shown on google maps. 

You can find a hosted version at https://mysterious-coast-80607.herokuapp.com/ 

## Campgrounds

The index page display all campgrounds listed on the website. On the nav bar you can also search for campgrounds by name.

## Wins 

I was introduced to some exciting technologies in web development such as JavaScript, Express, Node.js, MongoDB, git.github, heroku. From this project I got a real taste of coding and gained a good foundation knowledge of web development. 


## Future implementation

Features that I want to add are

* User can create a trip using collection of the campgrounds
* Recreate the app with React on the front end 
* Migrate to new version of Bootstrap
